To that he replied because I said so, and I can because I’m the general manager. Nowhere in the argument there was and profanity from either one of us, nor there was any raise of voice beyond reasonable excitement. I left the store, but before I left, I asked what his name was?

They said \"that ** all she does is complain, I made that food fresh, every time she calls in she always has something to ** about\", I have only ever called in aside from the other reasoning, but, to sometimes address how good the food was at that time or that \"hey you know, a drink was forgotten, no worries or rush just wanted y\\'all to know\", and that is about it, I have never been rude to these people ever and have ALWAYS tried to be civil, but, I addressed it on the phone and I said \"there is no right for y\\'all to talk so d*mn bad about me when I have never done anything to y\\'all\" and they guy told me \"you better stop cursing at me\", and I was like \"I am a grown woman in my 20\\'s, and y\\'all are ganging up against me in a public business and me on hold hearing it all\". This is downright disgusting and absolutely traumatic including all other experiences.I told them I will no longer order there anymore and will take my business to Papa Johns, and they said \"you can stop cussing at me is what you can do\", and I said d*mn twice, I am sure people has heard worse in this world, so, therefore, I addressed that I would be contacting corporate for the first time and will be writing reviews anywhere I can, I did not get around to talking to corporate as I had lost 4 relatives back to back due to Covid-19, and I just became overwhelmed with a lot in life, but, why I chose to write now, is I just called just a few moments ago, I told them \"hey I have not ordered here for a few months and I am a little nervous ordering again because I don\\'t want anyone to contaminate my food or spit on/destroy it\". The manager asked for my name and I gave my name, he said \"you are not allowed to order here anymore, thank you\" *disconnected*\"...So, this is how our local small town pizza parlor is, I HIGHLY recommend you do NOT order here and if you are ordering here frequently do not anymore, there are very rude people with disgusting personalities, and just because some have encountered good experiences, doesn\\'t mean you will all the time, I hope the public has learned something from my review and to give business to Papa Johns and or Pizza Hut, because they truly need it, the other place here is made up of snobby people and most folks who just don\\'t care how they act towards the public.

Serving Undercooked Chicken to Families can lead to serious health issues.Before I contact my Attorney with the photos of the Raw Chicken they served me which put my health at risk.

I was apologized to for the fact that no one had contacted me concerning this matter. I was told a $20.00 gift certificate would be e-mailed to me right away concerning this matter. I was also told that I would be given the telephone number for the district manager so that I could make a complaint to that person myself. I refused to do so. I then asked what they were going to do about it and I was told \"they were closing the matter and to accept the $20.00 gift certificate and that the complaint would be forwarded to the team.\" I asked \"what team?\" Turns out it is the same team that was in the location where the incident happened.

And there was nothing brushed on the burned crust.) Again, my husband had made clear we wanted the Parmesan sauce because we could not eat tomatoes. At this point, the person we were talking to may well have been the same person who took our order, but he did not identify himself in either case. I asked why we weren’t getting the treatment we had seen advertised on TV, where Domino’s executives deliver missing sauce to their customers. At this point the individual changed his tone slightly and told me what he should have said in the first place — “All my drivers are out, but I will prepare a replacement pizza for you and get it out as soon as someone comes in.” Ideally delivered in a friendly manner instead of the snarky tone of this guy. We said “okay” to a replacement, but then I called back within minutes to cancel the whole thing.

They are having a horribly hard time financially with no food in the house until the end of the month. I ordered a pizza for my friend. Her name is Pearl. Her daughter is sick right now with cancer and she has an oxygen tank on her 24/7. Her favorite food is Domino\\'s Pizza. Well it was until today. You see all my life I grew up on Papa John\\'s, Dominos and Pizza Hut and The Godfather\\'s Pizza!\\n                                        More\\n                                    Today\\'s experience truly was EYE opening and very sad for me as well as embarrassing for me. I am in San Diego Ca. She is located in Barstow. Now I ordered a pizza online for them using my DEBIT card because I can not do anything from where I am located at. I ordered a simple two pizzas and had it delivered to them. I also put it in the instructions. I Have done this over the past 20 years. May I remind you, I have ordered for family members many times and had it sent to their address. NEVER have I had an issue until today.The delivery driver came to the her house with me on the telephone and they said they needed to see a driver\\'s license and the credit card that purchased the food. They stated their best friend ordered the pizza for them as a gift to help out for Christmas to have something in there bellies. I have all the debit card Information. The delivery driver \"Tracy\" was extremely rude to my friend stating \"No Credit card and ID no pizza, You guys will need to call the company!\"I understand rules and regulations however remind you I did call ahead of time and asked them if I could order a pizza from San Diego to Barstow. They said YES. I have done this multiple times prior with out issue, They refused to give the pizzas to my best friend. So I am a Christian and I believe in forgiveness however when it comes to CORPORATE GREED such as this? On CHRISTMAS DAY The birth of Christ and to decline your neighbor food coming from such a \"Big Chain\" sickens me to my stomach that a world we live in could be so cold and sick.1. Moving forward I forgive them but I can promise you this has left such a sick sour taste in my mouth in regards to ALL DOMINOS Stores now, Simply due to ONE bad apple. I promise you I will NEVER EAT NOR PURCHASE FOOD from their store again, nor will I eat their pizza at any party or friend\\'s house. I will make sure all of my family and loved ones and friends STAY AWAY from Dominos and I pray forgiveness on their evil corporate greedy hearts. For any person that can NOT actually leave pizzas due to their circumstances due to their policy at Dominos? If this is a POLICY when ordering a pizza I need to see the written print that Indicates you can NOT order pizza for family or friends without having the card present. NEVER in my life have I shown my card so I called the office in Barstow and explained the situation. She was extremely rude and straight to the point. Obviously she is NOT happy working her job at Dominos and maybe upset because she had to work on Christmas, Or maybe if she would have gotten a REAL Career instead of working as a pizza maker/cashier for some company that is so greedy to bring the pizzas back after I purchased them with my hard earned money and to decline a family in need due to a policy that nobody does except for these people on this night?

Where this hidden policy is located at so I can see it? Also if they can make a one time exception due to circumstances. The women was straight to the point. \"Debit card holder has to be present, with photo ID\" NO ID NO DEBIT Card no pizza, I can refund the money to you? I said, \"Wow OK. How disgusting.\" She said, \"Yeah unfortunately a lot of Deliver drivers are just lazy and don\\'t follow the rules!\"\"Hang up!\"I called back with no answer. They kept me on hold forever. Cool so now I will do EVERYTHING and ANYTHING in my power to boycott this location and the company if you\\'re so Corporate greedy on Christmas day to not allow someone to eat a pizza due to policy...? Bring the pizzas back and eat them or throw them away?? So moving forward I will NEVER EVER order pizza from this establishment again nor will I help with bringing them any kind of business and trust me...I will make sure family and friends DO NOT support this place EVER again.This is Christmas? A Time to be thankful and celebrate Jesus\\' birthday. What kind of world are we coming to when such a BIG chain like Dominos has to decline pizza to somebody who is starving literally starving?

She just turned 16 and she has her first job and has her first card. Apparently there was an altercation about getting a refund because my daughter never got her pizza because she wasn’t at the hot spot. I just called the pizza place and they told me they in fact told my daughter they would not give her her money back. Jennifer to be specific.\\n                                        More\\n                                    I called and asked for a manager to calmly sort out the situation and she rudely told me what I need to do with my child and how I need to discipline her because I am hearing half the story and she told me my daughter and 70 year old mother repeatedly called there, harassed them and interrupted their dinner rush which is highly unacceptable. (Trust me I was shocked by the customer service and was only calling to see what happen to my daughter 21 dollars which is not hard to come by at 16. It’s kind of a big deal.) I had to redirect the young girl I was speaking to and calmly tell her that I was only calling to see what happen and why they didn’t refund the money. She said that was policy. I went in Domino\\'s website to read what they had written and it only says if you\\'re not satisfied they will refund your money. I asked her, \"Was this policy online?\" She started telling me how they are a five star restaurant. I asked her like my mother did prior for corporate number and she told me she can’t give that out. If I want it I should google it. (Really I spend money and put this food in my body and corporate number is not accessible to me? Mind you my mother a senior 70, not really a pro at the computer.) So she’s tells me this policy is a franchise policy that states if you order hotspot and the pizza not successfully delivered that you don’t get your money back. I had to ask for like the 10th time. \"I understand mam however is this policy somewhere visual for the customer.\" She stated, \"I don’t know???\" I thanked her and ended the phone call. There still a lot I didn’t not tell you but what is unacceptable is this employee\\'s behavior. I spent 10 min on the phone listening to this women tell me how my senior mother and my child were wrong and then she started giving instruction on how I need to correct my child. Unbelievable. I still didn’t get upset because that’s not what I do. However I am disturbed that this person is working. Oh and I don’t even know whom this women was because before she started reciting the franchise inside policy that she doesn’t know if it is visual to customer, she told me that the manager was on the phone and couldn’t come to the phone. Before I could finish my statement she cut me off in a very nasty condescending manner and said, \"Yes I know about this situation,\" and just went off. I still was very nice to her because she probably too is just a young child trying to make a couple of dollars. However Jennifer or the manager, I don’t know, I never got a chance to speak with them. I never got past the women whom knows policy but not whether is visual or not. It’s just really sad that we support business like this and I will Tweet, FB, Yelp, Pinterest and more this situation because it’s not fair to my daughter. It’s also not fair that I was very pleasant and I had to be cut off and told how to raise my child from a child. All because of a misunderstanding with ordering a pizza.

I noticed that Carlos, the driver was hesitant to give me my receipt and his name. I had to ask him his name three times! I hope the name he told me is correct, as it does not state his name on my receipt, but has server #3400 printed on it. Also... at first he told me that he did not have a receipt to give me and then a few minutes later, he produces one, saying... \"Oh I thought I left it at the restaurant.\" \\n                                        More\\n                                    So, a woman was sitting in the front passenger seat and a young girl was sitting in the back seat. So, the girl in the back seat passes my pizza box, chicken box, two liter Coke and three sauces to the woman in the front passenger seat, who then passed my items to the driver. He didn\\'t have my pizza or my chicken in the heat wave red bag, but sitting on the back seat! So, Carlos then hands me all of my six items, without a bag or any napkins! All this was quite cumbersome to carry with no bag! It wasn\\'t professional that he had passengers in the car, handling my food. This is shockingly my first time experiencing a driver having passengers in his vehicle, having a child pass me my food! I didn\\'t know that Domino\\'s employs children and passengers to help the driver hand the customers their food. It wasn\\'t very appetizing to see my food change so many hands. I have never had a driver act so ** and unprofessional delivering my food with passengers in the car, let alone handling my food!!! It didn\\'t help matters that he didn\\'t even say thank you for my order! He said that I should blame the GM, general manager for no bag or no napkins. I am quite sure that Carlos could have found a bag in Domino\\'s and some napkins! My Goodness! Domino\\'s should go out of business if they can\\'t supply these basic staples with an order. Carlos also had no Domino\\'s sign or banner on his car. I was standing outside, not seeing a Domino banner on his car. I could not tell what car driving by was his. He lied and said he was inside the parking lot fence but I was standing outside waiting for him and he did not arrive before me! Now... onto the food, which made my experience go from bad to worst. The food was greasy and gross, with too much tomato sauce and grease on the pizza and barely warm!!! The chicken looked like it was re-heated over, with dried up tomatoes on top of it and didn\\'t taste fresh either! It too was swimming in grease. It made me feel queasy and upset my stomach! I ended up throwing this Domino\\'s food in the garbage! I reached out to Domino\\'s. Mary ** of Domino\\'s Risk Management cowardly sent me an email and wasn\\'t professional enough to call. I gave them my number to find out about my bad ordeal with this order! She said in her email that she was not going to do anything to fix this bad ordeal. I even sent her pictures so she could see all the grease! The boxes even had the grease soaked through, getting me and my clothes greasy! I also gave them my order number from off of my receipt! So... public, please don\\'t give Carlos and his store #3347 or Mary ** of Domino\\'s Risk Mgmt Dept any business! My hard earned money spent on this garbage meant absolutely nothing to her.

Well... years later, with my first online purchase last night... their pizza is worst than cardboard tasting! It is extremely greasy, under cooked, doughy tasting, gooey with way too much tomato sauce and my chicken dish was also very greasy and stale! This is way too much turmoil to go through!

After I placed my order, which was a 14\" double beef hand tossed pizza, I drove over to 2307 Reidville Road located in Spartanburg, SC 29301. This restaurant\\'s setup looked pretty decent, but a few people, especially the one older male with the open sores and cuts on the back of his hands between his fingers and knuckles, ruined my first (and last) visit there. As I was waiting to pay for my order, I looked to my right, and I seen this older male preparing the pizza dough. As I was watching him, I had paid for my order and, then, I noticed that he was preparing the dough with his bare hands. From where I was standing, I had noticed two red soars on the back of his right hand, and to be very sure that he had sores on the back of hands, I walked up to him. \\n                                        More\\n                                    While standing in front of the glass barrier, which appeared to serve as health and spectator barrier, I asked him if I could see his hands. This employee showed me his hands. Needless to say, this no caring about CUSTOMERS\\' HEALTH, DOMINO\\'S EMPLOYEE, OLDER ADULT MALE was preparing the pizza dough with open sores on the back of his hands between his knuckles and fingers with no gloves on. I mean he was mashing and spreading and mashing that dough with his disregard-for-the-customer ungloved hands. So, this began to upset me, because a lot of people have been dying from germ and bacteria illnesses (ex. flu). So, very loudly, I had asked him,\"Why are you making pizzas with cuts and sores on your hands knowing that people are ordering food from here?\" His reply was that nothing was getting on the back of his hands while he was help making pizzas, which was a big lie, and he mentioned that he hurt his hands on the oven. By this time, I heard a young female tell that employee, \"You know you should be wearing gloves.\" Eventually that employee was removed and I voiced that I wanted a refund. While waiting for several minutes to talk to the store manager, which was not there, a younger fat male employee told me that he did not see an issue with that guy making pizzas because once the pizzas get in the oven, that the oven would kill the germs. I told that employee to get the ** out of my face with that stupid **. After that ignorant moment, a female employee had told him to be quiet and move. Next, a different male employee mentioned that he would make me another pizza. I told him no, I just want a refund. In the meantime, while still waiting on my refund, no one threw away the pizza dough, no one sanitized the pizza dough prep area, and no one did anything regarding public safety at that Reidville Road location in Spartanburg, South Carolina.

I will be opening a dispute case for the transaction with my bank.Few important things I learned from the whole experience: Domino’s will you charge you even if they mess up your order. The staff including supervisors and customer service reps are trained to not lose/refund money for a single order even if it means losing the customer. They don't care about customers at all since they have millions of them. This is worst worst experience so far I had with any restaurant where they take your money for food that was not delivered and then simply dodge you when asking for a refund. Never ordering again from Domino’s again.\\n                                    More\\n                                \")\n",

I\\'ve never received such a crazy percentage discount from any kind of company. This makes me think that they purposely overprice their pizzas, then send out massive amounts of coupons to look good. There\\'s no other explanation. The issue is when you stop getting coupons. What I used to do was use every online coupon I could, student coupon deals, and I\\'d personally email representatives and also fill out customer response surveys to keep getting more coupons sent to my home address. BUT, after I kept using 50% off coupons for about six months, my phone number and address pretty much got blocked from receiving further coupons!\\n                                        More\\n                                    In fact, the very last pizza I had order with Domino\\'s had such, such terrible customer service that led me to this fact. After I had asked for my subtotal with a 50% off coupon, the fellow on the phone told me, \"Dude. You\\'ve used 50% off coupons like ten times now. Please tell me how to get them, I want them too!\" which I knew was clearly bait, but I told him in response a truthful statement, \"I am a valued customer, I complete surveys and always give feedback.\" Then, instead of the usual faces who delivered my pizza I saw some kind of hotshot supervisor who drove a very luxurious vehicle. I gave him my final 50% off coupon, and he furiously searched through it for anything that could be incorrect. To his dismay, it was a correct and legal, bonafide coupon - both the address and the expiration date were okay.After that, I\\'d still give feedback, complete surveys etc. while providing my address, but instead, no more coupons ever came to my house like before. So for some reason, it seems like someone high-up put something in their system to never give me coupons again. I kept doing what I was doing for a few more months - I even wrote a review that was so amazing, my local branch stuck on their wall in their employee area, but no more coupons ever came. See, the truth was that my mother had an accident, so we had to order food on the days she required physiotherapy each week - and Domino\\'s was one of my favourite places because of the 50% off coupons. That review I made is what got posted in their employee area, according to a representative that I spoke with, and I was quite proud that I could make them feel good because their pizzas were top-notch.Just a really big shame. I would\\'ve kept ordering from Domino\\'s if I never got the 50% off coupons at all! It\\'s the fact that you would give me these coupons each month, then make a big stink about it that really makes me sad. Seriously - I\\'d get mailed these coupons so frequently, then the customer representative I would call to order my pizzas would complain about me using them? I would always shove these coupons in their face, even when I wasn\\'t asked to because I want to be completely transparent. If I had ordered and not produced the coupons, then I would understand the company being mad, but that is clearly not the case! They got mad at me because I was, essentially, a fellow taking advantage of their deals and they didn\\'t like that.Anyways, my recommendation is to just spend a similar amount of money and get pizzas from elsewhere. Pizza Nova is definitely good. But, I really, really love Pizza Hut now because their pizzas are extremely thick - just a couple of those slices would fill me up for the whole day!

First of all, I had to ask him a few times if indeed he was the manager, and second that if he speaks to all customers in this tone of voice, which was practically screaming on the phone and not letting me express my complaint over the phone. I work for a huge institution (a University Hospital) in which we continuously order pizza from this particular store. After the whole 8 minute conversation he continued to state that all I was after was a free meal and that he would give me credit for my $37.27 order. I expressed that I did not want a credit of 37 dollars to order from this store again! How can I accept a credit of $37 dollars from this store on my next phone order, if the quality of food is in-excusable, nor adequate for consuming (dry pizza and burned food). Sorry but this is not acceptable. I would be scared to order from this store again with any kind of store credit, not knowing if they will spit on my food or do something terrible to my order, considering the way their manager talked over the phone. True, I was calling to complain, so they can fix the quality of pizza and continue to be the above leveled \"Domino\\'s\" we know, but to have a Manager practically cuss me out over the phone is not right. He did not offer me a so-called credit on my next order until I asked for a corporate telephone number so I can call to further address this issue.

Evidently their conveyor belt system does not allow them a way to get the pizzas out once they go in (sounds like a fire hazard to me) - so no pizza.\\n                                        More\\n                                    The guys there assured me when lights went back on they would cancel the order which would mean no charge to my credit card. WRONG. The next day was Sunday - charge was there but no refund yet so I called on Monday thinking manager would be there. WRONG. First person was a driver - next person was someone who had to be pretending she was a manager because she did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING but piss me off. Since the first guy cold transferred me to her I had to repeat the issue - her first response was \"you didn\\'t call yesterday?\"The conversation went from bad to worse and finally her idea of helping me was to tell ME to call back later in the afternoon when the manager was there and explain what happened. Uhm ME? I told her the correct response for a customer service resolution would be to have the MANAGER call me KNOWING all the information. She told me \"I AM helpin\\' you but you need to call the manager when he is at the store and tell \\'em what happen. I am a good manager.\" Yep - that is what she said. So needless to say I paid $50 online to drive over, wait 40 minutes for nothing and now have to spend all this time finding someone to credit me for pizzas I never received. I can\\'t WAIT to see what happens this afternoon.\\n                                    More\\n                                ')\n",

I didn\\'t want them to drive all the way here for a salad so I ordered wings and a Coke as well.

So I tell him to back off since both of us are being recorded on camera, and the police can easily see the footage. He backs off to the other side of the store and keeps staring at us.Alexis starts making the pizzas, she is not wearing any polythene gloves used in food processing. She put the cheese and meat, and then shockingly reached into the waste and scrap (dump) pit under the table, grabbed pepperoni and sausage pieces and put them on my pizza. (This pit/dump is a collection bin for all the scrap and waste that gets cleaned off the prep table to be discarded.) When I questioned her she completely denied it and handed me the boxes and walked into the back of the store. I hope there is a CCTV camera in the prep & cooking area to see this scenario unfold. Needless to say, I walked out and left the full boxes on the trash bin outside the store.Domino\\'s will never get my business again.

The texture of the crust was DEFINITELY off and then I began to have a seemingly unpleasant after taste. But we were hungry. My husband and I ate, my boys (who usually put away 6 slices each) only ate 2 each. Ok. No big deal. I chalked it up to a new person or dough issues so I called to let them know. I went as far as to say I\\'m not wanting anything in return, just wanted to let them know.I was a baker for years, so I suggested it was something about the crust, and that it also tasted boarding on burnt. He actually tried to say it couldn\\'t burn cause he had no control over the conveyor belt and oven temp, that is all set up perfectly so not to burn. DID HE REALLY THINK I\\'M THAT CLUELESS?! So, I kindly resound that it could very well have been the dough was old or something, and he actually said, \"it was possible it wasn\\'t ready.\" He then says he actually was off yesterday and wasn\\'t quite sure when this dough was delivered. Ok. Don\\'t try to treat me like a clueless drone and in the same breath start explaining a scenario. It just doesn\\'t work like that.But, when a customer isn\\'t even asking for anything to actually be done about it other than just wanting to bring it to your attention so it\\'s not happening to countless other customers, SHOW SOME APPRECIATION and common decency that someone else may know how to bake/cook.

I have utilized the tip line when I do on the off chance get a great employee and to find out that the great employee isn't even getting the tip makes me feel ripped off.

He did apologize and said that I would receive a credit for the next time I ordered. I thought, \"ok, no big deal\" and I can go get me a 2 liter at the store down the road.

I told him what my correct address is and even said that it\\'s correct in the online app when I place my orders. He said he would have to remake my order to have it delivered fresh. I was not happy about this. I checked the online app and it said my order had been delivered. Which was false. This really set me off. That is the single most way to lose me as a customer and that\\'s dishonesty. So after 2 hours of placing my order, it finally arrives. The driver makes no apologies whatsoever. Driver doesn\\'t say anything at all really. Of course I left no tip.

The one ended up being 8.07, and the other was 8.47. I didnt order anything extra, I didnt add anything other than the 3 toppings, but they still end up costing more than their advertised special. It doesnt seem like much of a big deal because its only a few cents, but when you add the thousands of people that probably get overcharged, it adds up.

Are you the individual that I had just spoken to on the phone?\" The employee then states, \"Uhhh, well, my name isn\\'t Shawn **.\" I replied, \"No, my name is Shawn **, and I believe you are the person that I had spoken to over the phone a little ago (the voice matched perfectly).

Do you understand that you unwillingly cancelled my order and then hung up on me?\"** stated, \"Well, you told me to cancel it.\" I stated, \"No, I sure did not. I wanted to know where my order was at in your process. Also, you were highly rude to me over the phone, and I was completely shocked that you cancelled my order, and then just hung up on me.\" I then advised that I wanted his manager\\'s name, in order to inquire as to if this is the type of customer service his store has to offer.

I got up to the register to pay for my stuff and asked the kid to add 5 garlic butters which brought my total to $19.66. The kid had some problems logging into the computer in order to charge my card and kept having to ask the other rude employee what her pin code was. I didn\\'t really think anything of it so I paid, took my pizzas and left. I get home and one of my pizzas were completely wrong and another one was kinda burnt. Overall they all tasted just ok but I didn\\'t call in and complain. I just ate the pizza and tried to be happy. Well then, on Friday November 20th I was at the store at work trying to purchase a soda because I work in a call center and use my voice all day long. My debit card got declined. I was like \"what in the world there should definitely be money in my account\". I log into my banking app on my phone and discover multiple charges from Dominos on my account. The original one for $19.66 and another for $22.93 on Monday the 16th and then multiple pending charges from Friday the 20th. Five days after ordering my pizza they were charging my credit card even though I hadn\\'t been home all day. I freaked as you can imagine and called the store and demanded to know what was up. I was on my first break at work and my break was almost up so when the kid that answered the phone, asked me to put me on hold, I said \"no\". He was very rude from that point on even after I explained what was going on and then I told him I needed resolution ASAP. He commented that he couldn\\'t do anything for me so I told him to take down my contact info and have the manager call me back with a resolution during my lunch at 8:45 pm. When 8:45 got there I called back and asked to speak to the manager myself and he was very very rude and not apologetic at all. I explained the whole situation and then demanded a refund for all the charges that were on my card including the pizza charge for the inconvenience. The manager said that the only amount he could refund me was the original $19.66 and that the only way he could do that was if I gave him my debit card info over the phone which I obviously vetoed. I said that I would just come in the next day with my card and have them refund me where I could see it at which point he said \"you won\\'t be able to watch me anyways because I\\'ll have to do it in the back office.\" At this point I was very irate and told him that I guess I would just have to go to the better business bureau and hung up. I called Dominos Corporate number and spoke to a lady there. I gave her all the information I had at the time and told her that the resolution I wanted was for all the charges refunded and any overdraft fees that I incurred to be taken care of. She told me that there was nothing she could do for me because that was a franchise store and therefore all she could do is forward it to the owner of the franchise. I said \"ok\", got off the phone with her and then called my bank\\'s stolen credit card line. What I found out after talking to them floored me. They said that the charge from the 16th was from a completely different Dominos in Charlotte, NC and that there were 5 other pending transactions from either that store or another one also in Charlotte, NC. which is why my debit card was declined. I cut off my card and reported it lost/stolen so that nothing else would attempt to come through. On my way home that night (which was around 1 am), I called the local police department and filed a report. They met me up at the original Dominos and I explained the situation to them. But now I\\'m sitting here with no card, no money and no way to get my money back. I drive an hour one way to work each day and I don\\'t even have money for gas to get to work and Dominos acts like they couldn\\'t care.

Our order arrived promptly and without error and we were excited about having some wings to enjoy with an awesome hockey game. The wings themselves were hot but overly greasy, but we ate them without hesitation and soon suffered the consequence. Very soon after the Flyers won an amazing 6-5 OT win against Dallas, we both had the sudden urge to vomit, just to purge the grease-fest that was brewing in our stomachs. The taste of zest blue cheese and (mild) hot sauce is not nearly as satisfying in this manner. We do appreciate the fast delivery, and at a much later hour than any other restaurant is open, but will not be making any rash decisions about ordering from Domino's again even if our team is tied in the third period and we're really hungry for some wings.\")\n",

I asked if I could pay when I pick up, because I was walking to my girlfriend’s house to get my wallet, which I had forgotten before I left for school. All was well. When I arrived to pick up the pizza about 15 minutes later, it was ready and waiting for me and a driver was coming in at the same time. The employee who made my pizza, DJ, asked the driver to ring me up because he was busy making a pizza. The driver rung me up and stated that the total was $16 and change, which I knew was incorrect because I come in every week to get the $7.99 3-topping carryout special, always pepperoni and extra bacon, and the chicken was only $5.99. The driver immediately realized the problem and informed me that I had been rung up for a 1-topping pizza plus 2 additional toppings. No big deal, I assume on normal days that\\'s how a 3-topping pizza is rung up.\\n                                        More\\n                                    Before I paid, I lifted up the lid of the pizza box to see how much bacon was on the pizza, because normally there is more than enough bacon for me and my girlfriend, but a few times the person making the pizza forgot that it was extra bacon, and they are always more than happy to fix it. The driver informed me that they would have to sprinkle the bacon on top instead of making a new pizza, which I was fine with. No sense wasting an entire pizza, I don\\'t mind having to wait 5 minutes to get my correct order. The driver then turned to DJ and asked him if he would mind cooking up a few extra pieces, to which DJ got an attitude, glared at me and said, \"No, I gave him extra bacon.\" The driver then turned to me and said that there was nothing he could do because DJ had given me extra bacon. I then told the driver to just cancel my pizza, because the amount of bacon on the pizza was what I used to get with a single order of bacon. I would not have had a problem with the order and just chalked it up to poor portioning had DJ not have gotten an attitude. After all, I wasn\\'t asking for much, just to get what I paid for (I would like to mention here that I always get extra bacon because I do like to have a decent amount of bacon on my pizza, and only twice have I requested a bit extra. I like having at least one-piece bacon in every bite, which I don\\'t feel is too much to ask). The driver attempted to change my order, but needed a reduced authorization (?) so DJ came flying around the corner asking what was wrong with my order, and the driver told him that I did not want the pizza. DJ shouted at me saying, \"Dude, I swear on my life I put extra bacon on here!\" to which I told him that there was no extra, that I normally get way more than that. Again, I don\\'t expect much from a pizza, that\\'s why I order extra bacon, because I like having a little bit more than what normally comes on the pizza, and to me the pizza looked like a normal serving, with all the bacon clumped in the middle. DJ then said, \"Well, you\\'re wrong!\" and grabbed the pizza box and threw it on the shelf, and went back around to making his pizza. I then verified with the driver that his name was DJ and I didn\\'t hear it wrong, paid for my chicken and left.In this entire situation, I would have just paid for my order and left, but I do not need to be disrespected by employees and told that I am wrong on an order that I get every week. I know my order, and I am a very reasonable person. I understand that Domino\\'s is a company and part of being a company is not giving out pounds of bacon on each pizza, that\\'s not what I was asking for. I know how much bacon I normally get, and honestly, the amount I normally get is more than enough. I don\\'t want to say too much because it is bacon after all. But like I said, that bacon isn\\'t the issue here; it is merely the catalyst to why I am complaining.

I was very patient and didn\\'t complain. I waited for her to make the second pizza and although the toppings were perfect the pizza was burnt (I asked for well done but not burnt). I observed her making my second pizza, placing it back in the oven mid way and leaving it at the end of the oven for some minutes as she made someone else\\'s order. Now I can\\'t say this is why it was burnt. \\n                                        More\\n                                    I attempt to show her the difference between well done and burnt, asking her to bring out the 1st pizza that she messed up and comparing it to the second in which it was a drastic difference. I attempt to express to her my complaint and observation. She started to overtalk me by telling me to be quiet. Things went left quickly and it was not professional at alllll. I mentioned to her that I don\\'t want to argue over a pizza. I just want my money back and she continued to cut me off by telling me to \"hush, stop talking **, the customer is not always right and the cameras are right there... You can be banned from this store.\" I am beyond pissed and disappointed as I\\'ve worked in the fast food industry before and I would never treat a paying customer this way. I am not confrontational but she treated me as if I was. She wanted me to leave the store but at the same time was holding my money hostage as I asked multiple times for my money back. As I waited for my money she continued to tell me to \"hush and be quiet.\" I continue to express how this is the worst customer service ever. I asked for the manager and she said she is the manager. I asked for a pen to write down her name in which she completely ignored. Let\\'s just say I apologize for letting it escalate but realized when I got home that I did nothing wrong except attempt to show her the difference between burnt and well done. She called me when I got home to apologize and credit my order, but I will prob never order from this location again. Allll of this for a pizza??!!

They said \"that ** all she does is complain, I made that food fresh, every time she calls in she always has something to ** about\", I have only ever called in aside from the other reasoning, but, to sometimes address how good the food was at that time or that \"hey you know, a drink was forgotten, no worries or rush just wanted y\\'all to know\", and that is about it, I have never been rude to these people ever and have ALWAYS tried to be civil, but, I addressed it on the phone and I said \"there is no right for y\\'all to talk so d*mn bad about me when I have never done anything to y\\'all\" and they guy told me \"you better stop cursing at me\", and I was like \"I am a grown woman in my 20\\'s, and y\\'all are ganging up against me in a public business and me on hold hearing it all\". This is downright disgusting and absolutely traumatic including all other experiences.I told them I will no longer order there anymore and will take my business to Papa Johns, and they said \"you can stop cussing at me is what you can do\", and I said d*mn twice, I am sure people has heard worse in this world, so, therefore, I addressed that I would be contacting corporate for the first time and will be writing reviews anywhere I can, I did not get around to talking to corporate as I had lost 4 relatives back to back due to Covid-19, and I just became overwhelmed with a lot in life, but, why I chose to write now, is I just called just a few moments ago, I told them \"hey I have not ordered here for a few months and I am a little nervous ordering again because I don\\'t want anyone to contaminate my food or spit on/destroy it\". The manager asked for my name and I gave my name, he said \"you are not allowed to order here anymore, thank you\" *disconnected*\"...So, this is how our local small town pizza parlor is, I HIGHLY recommend you do NOT order here and if you are ordering here frequently do not anymore, there are very rude people with disgusting personalities, and just because some have encountered good experiences, doesn\\'t mean you will all the time, I hope the public has learned something from my review and to give business to Papa Johns and or Pizza Hut, because they truly need it, the other place here is made up of snobby people and most folks who just don\\'t care how they act towards the public.

Her daughter is sick right now with cancer and she has an oxygen tank on her 24/7. Her favorite food is Domino\\'s Pizza. Well it was until today.

I am in San Diego Ca. She is located in Barstow. Now I ordered a pizza online for them using my DEBIT card because I can not do anything from where I am located at. I ordered a simple two pizzas and had it delivered to them. I also put it in the instructions. I Have done this over the past 20 years. May I remind you, I have ordered for family members many times and had it sent to their address. NEVER have I had an issue until today.The delivery driver came to the her house with me on the telephone and they said they needed to see a driver\\'s license and the credit card that purchased the food. They stated their best friend ordered the pizza for them as a gift to help out for Christmas to have something in there bellies. I have all the debit card Information. The delivery driver \"Tracy\" was extremely rude to my friend stating \"No Credit card and ID no pizza, You guys will need to call the company!\"I understand rules and regulations however remind you I did call ahead of time and asked them if I could order a pizza from San Diego to Barstow. They said YES. I have done this multiple times prior with out issue, They refused to give the pizzas to my best friend. So I am a Christian and I believe in forgiveness however when it comes to CORPORATE GREED such as this? On CHRISTMAS DAY The birth of Christ and to decline your neighbor food coming from such a \"Big Chain\" sickens me to my stomach that a world we live in could be so cold and sick.1.

NEVER in my life have I shown my card so I called the office in Barstow and explained the situation. She was extremely rude and straight to the point. Obviously she is NOT happy working her job at Dominos and maybe upset because she had to work on Christmas, Or maybe if she would have gotten a REAL Career instead of working as a pizza maker/cashier for some company that is so greedy to bring the pizzas back after I purchased them with my hard earned money and to decline a family in need due to a policy that nobody does except for these people on this night?

Where this hidden policy is located at so I can see it? Also if they can make a one time exception due to circumstances. The women was straight to the point. \"Debit card holder has to be present, with photo ID\" NO ID NO DEBIT Card no pizza, I can refund the money to you? I said, \"Wow OK. How disgusting.\" She said, \"Yeah unfortunately a lot of Deliver drivers are just lazy and don\\'t follow the rules!\"\"Hang up!\"I called back with no answer. They kept me on hold forever. Cool so now I will do EVERYTHING and ANYTHING in my power to boycott this location and the company if you\\'re so Corporate greedy on Christmas day to not allow someone to eat a pizza due to policy...? Bring the pizzas back and eat them or throw them away??

I just called the pizza place and they told me they in fact told my daughter they would not give her her money back.

(Trust me I was shocked by the customer service and was only calling to see what happen to my daughter 21 dollars which is not hard to come by at 16. It’s kind of a big deal.) I had to redirect the young girl I was speaking to and calmly tell her that I was only calling to see what happen and why they didn’t refund the money. She said that was policy. I went in Domino\\'s website to read what they had written and it only says if you\\'re not satisfied they will refund your money. I asked her, \"Was this policy online?\" She started telling me how they are a five star restaurant. I asked her like my mother did prior for corporate number and she told me she can’t give that out. If I want it I should google it. (Really I spend money and put this food in my body and corporate number is not accessible to me? Mind you my mother a senior 70, not really a pro at the computer.) So she’s tells me this policy is a franchise policy that states if you order hotspot and the pizza not successfully delivered that you don’t get your money back. I had to ask for like the 10th time. \"I understand mam however is this policy somewhere visual for the customer.\" She stated, \"I don’t know???\" I thanked her and ended the phone call. There still a lot I didn’t not tell you but what is unacceptable is this employee\\'s behavior. I spent 10 min on the phone listening to this women tell me how my senior mother and my child were wrong and then she started giving instruction on how I need to correct my child. Unbelievable. I still didn’t get upset because that’s not what I do. However I am disturbed that this person is working. Oh and I don’t even know whom this women was because before she started reciting the franchise inside policy that she doesn’t know if it is visual to customer, she told me that the manager was on the phone and couldn’t come to the phone. Before I could finish my statement she cut me off in a very nasty condescending manner and said, \"Yes I know about this situation,\" and just went off. I still was very nice to her because she probably too is just a young child trying to make a couple of dollars. However Jennifer or the manager, I don’t know, I never got a chance to speak with them. I never got past the women whom knows policy but not whether is visual or not. It’s just really sad that we support business like this and I will Tweet, FB, Yelp, Pinterest and more this situation because it’s not fair to my daughter. It’s also not fair that I was very pleasant and I had to be cut off and told how to raise my child from a child. All because of a misunderstanding with ordering a pizza.

This is shockingly my first time experiencing a driver having passengers in his vehicle, having a child pass me my food!

The food was greasy and gross, with too much tomato sauce and grease on the pizza and barely warm!!! The chicken looked like it was re-heated over, with dried up tomatoes on top of it and didn\\'t taste fresh either! It too was swimming in grease. It made me feel queasy and upset my stomach! I ended up throwing this Domino\\'s food in the garbage! I reached out to Domino\\'s. Mary ** of Domino\\'s Risk Management cowardly sent me an email and wasn\\'t professional enough to call. I gave them my number to find out about my bad ordeal with this order! She said in her email that she was not going to do anything to fix this bad ordeal. I even sent her pictures so she could see all the grease! The boxes even had the grease soaked through, getting me and my clothes greasy! I also gave them my order number from off of my receipt!

After I placed my order, which was a 14\" double beef hand tossed pizza, I drove over to 2307 Reidville Road located in Spartanburg, SC 29301. This restaurant\\'s setup looked pretty decent, but a few people, especially the one older male with the open sores and cuts on the back of his hands between his fingers and knuckles, ruined my first (and last) visit there.

As I was watching him, I had paid for my order and, then, I noticed that he was preparing the dough with his bare hands.

I mean he was mashing and spreading and mashing that dough with his disregard-for-the-customer ungloved hands. So, this began to upset me, because a lot of people have been dying from germ and bacteria illnesses (ex. flu). So, very loudly, I had asked him,\"Why are you making pizzas with cuts and sores on your hands knowing that people are ordering food from here?\" His reply was that nothing was getting on the back of his hands while he was help making pizzas, which was a big lie, and he mentioned that he hurt his hands on the oven. By this time, I heard a young female tell that employee, \"You know you should be wearing gloves.\" Eventually that employee was removed and I voiced that I wanted a refund. While waiting for several minutes to talk to the store manager, which was not there, a younger fat male employee told me that he did not see an issue with that guy making pizzas because once the pizzas get in the oven, that the oven would kill the germs. I told that employee to get the ** out of my face with that stupid **. After that ignorant moment, a female employee had told him to be quiet and move. Next, a different male employee mentioned that he would make me another pizza. I told him no, I just want a refund. In the meantime, while still waiting on my refund, no one threw away the pizza dough, no one sanitized the pizza dough prep area, and no one did anything regarding public safety at that Reidville Road location in Spartanburg, South Carolina.

After about 40 minutes the tracker app showed that the driver had left the store with the order. Did not receive the order even after 1 hour (around 6:50 PM) from placing the order. So called the store and they mentioned that the order should be there in 10 minutes. Waited for another 25 minutes and still no show. So called the store again at around 7:15 PM and they said it was a busy day and I should receive the order in another 25 minutes. So I called the corporate customer service number at around 7:25 PM and they said that they will look into the issue. Called the store again at around 7:45 PM since I had still not received the order and they simply hung up on me.

I did not get the refund so I called the customer service number again on December 4th, 2017 and they provided me with the number to the department who was handling it. Called the number provided by customer care several times and no one answered. After almost an hour I got a call back from that number and the person speaking said he was a supervisor. He pretended to be not able to understand what I was saying, but finally took my number and said I will get a refund. I will be opening a dispute case for the transaction with my bank.Few important things I learned from the whole experience: Domino’s will you charge you even if they mess up your order. The staff including supervisors and customer service reps are trained to not lose/refund money for a single order even if it means losing the customer. They don't care about customers at all since they have millions of them.

I\\'ve never received such a crazy percentage discount from any kind of company. This makes me think that they purposely overprice their pizzas, then send out massive amounts of coupons to look good. There\\'s no other explanation. The issue is when you stop getting coupons. What I used to do was use every online coupon I could, student coupon deals, and I\\'d personally email representatives and also fill out customer response surveys to keep getting more coupons sent to my home address. BUT, after I kept using 50% off coupons for about six months, my phone number and address pretty much got blocked from receiving further coupons!\\n                                        More\\n                                    In fact, the very last pizza I had order with Domino\\'s had such, such terrible customer service that led me to this fact. After I had asked for my subtotal with a 50% off coupon, the fellow on the phone told me, \"Dude. You\\'ve used 50% off coupons like ten times now. Please tell me how to get them, I want them too!\" which I knew was clearly bait, but I told him in response a truthful statement, \"I am a valued customer, I complete surveys and always give feedback.\" Then, instead of the usual faces who delivered my pizza I saw some kind of hotshot supervisor who drove a very luxurious vehicle. I gave him my final 50% off coupon, and he furiously searched through it for anything that could be incorrect. To his dismay, it was a correct and legal, bonafide coupon - both the address and the expiration date were okay.After that, I\\'d still give feedback, complete surveys etc. while providing my address, but instead, no more coupons ever came to my house like before. So for some reason, it seems like someone high-up put something in their system to never give me coupons again. I kept doing what I was doing for a few more months - I even wrote a review that was so amazing, my local branch stuck on their wall in their employee area, but no more coupons ever came. See, the truth was that my mother had an accident, so we had to order food on the days she required physiotherapy each week - and Domino\\'s was one of my favourite places because of the 50% off coupons. That review I made is what got posted in their employee area, according to a representative that I spoke with, and I was quite proud that I could make them feel good because their pizzas were top-notch.Just a really big shame. I would\\'ve kept ordering from Domino\\'s if I never got the 50% off coupons at all! It\\'s the fact that you would give me these coupons each month, then make a big stink about it that really makes me sad. Seriously - I\\'d get mailed these coupons so frequently, then the customer representative I would call to order my pizzas would complain about me using them? I would always shove these coupons in their face, even when I wasn\\'t asked to because I want to be completely transparent. If I had ordered and not produced the coupons, then I would understand the company being mad, but that is clearly not the case! They got mad at me because I was, essentially, a fellow taking advantage of their deals and they didn\\'t like that.Anyways, my recommendation is to just spend a similar amount of money and get pizzas from elsewhere. Pizza Nova is definitely good. But, I really, really love Pizza Hut now because their pizzas are extremely thick - just a couple of those slices would fill me up for the whole day!

I ordered this at 8 pm and they told me my driver left with my order at 8:50 on the online tracker so I was surprised because it is usually not that fast.\\n                                        More\\n                                    As time started to go by... I noticed it was 9:30 and called in to ask if the order was on its way and they put me on hold for 8 minutes so I hang up and call again and the lady who answered said \"we are very behind and it will probably be there in a bit. Do you still want it?\" As hungry as I was I decided not to cancel and wait a couple more minutes. Or hours. At 10:40 I decided to call back again (already giving up) to cancel my order and as soon as I\\'m on hold for another 6 minutes, they ring my doorbell where the driver not only did not apologize but made us pay when it should have been free at this point. When we got the food it was cold so that was a plus.\\n                                    More\\n                                ')\n",

My friend said he was probably in the wrong hotel. He told us he knew the address we were staying at and that he was in the lobby. Later that night, (about 1 am) everyone on our floor had been woken up. Some were awake because they had been called by another room on that floor, some were awake because they heard banging on their doors and someone jiggling the doorknob trying to get in. We called the front desk. They told us it was probably just the ice machine and not to worry about it. When we asked them to check the cameras, they would not do it and told us there was nothing to worry about. We kept hearing it throughout most of the night and every time we looked through the peephole on the door, no one was there. There was also banging in the doors between the shared rooms. According to the front desk, no one was in those rooms. I'm not sure if someone hacked in to Domino's website, or what happened, but it was creepy and the hotel was definitely not making us feel any safer.

I explained the whole situation and then demanded a refund for all the charges that were on my card including the pizza charge for the inconvenience. The manager said that the only amount he could refund me was the original $19.66 and that the only way he could do that was if I gave him my debit card info over the phone which I obviously vetoed. I said that I would just come in the next day with my card and have them refund me where I could see it at which point he said \"you won\\'t be able to watch me anyways because I\\'ll have to do it in the back office.\" At this point I was very irate and told him that I guess I would just have to go to the better business bureau and hung up. I called Dominos Corporate number and spoke to a lady there. I gave her all the information I had at the time and told her that the resolution I wanted was for all the charges refunded and any overdraft fees that I incurred to be taken care of. She told me that there was nothing she could do for me because that was a franchise store and therefore all she could do is forward it to the owner of the franchise. I said \"ok\", got off the phone with her and then called my bank\\'s stolen credit card line. What I found out after talking to them floored me. They said that the charge from the 16th was from a completely different Dominos in Charlotte, NC and that there were 5 other pending transactions from either that store or another one also in Charlotte, NC. which is why my debit card was declined. I cut off my card and reported it lost/stolen so that nothing else would attempt to come through. On my way home that night (which was around 1 am), I called the local police department and filed a report. They met me up at the original Dominos and I explained the situation to them.

A request though - please do not penalize the responsible person financially, I am sure everyone works hard, but ensure that they take each order seriously and make notes clearly every time.

I asked if I could pay when I pick up, because I was walking to my girlfriend’s house to get my wallet, which I had forgotten before I left for school. All was well. When I arrived to pick up the pizza about 15 minutes later, it was ready and waiting for me and a driver was coming in at the same time. The employee who made my pizza, DJ, asked the driver to ring me up because he was busy making a pizza. The driver rung me up and stated that the total was $16 and change, which I knew was incorrect because I come in every week to get the $7.99 3-topping carryout special, always pepperoni and extra bacon, and the chicken was only $5.99. The driver immediately realized the problem and informed me that I had been rung up for a 1-topping pizza plus 2 additional toppings. No big deal, I assume on normal days that\\'s how a 3-topping pizza is rung up.\\n                                        More\\n                                    Before I paid, I lifted up the lid of the pizza box to see how much bacon was on the pizza, because normally there is more than enough bacon for me and my girlfriend, but a few times the person making the pizza forgot that it was extra bacon, and they are always more than happy to fix it. The driver informed me that they would have to sprinkle the bacon on top instead of making a new pizza, which I was fine with. No sense wasting an entire pizza, I don\\'t mind having to wait 5 minutes to get my correct order. The driver then turned to DJ and asked him if he would mind cooking up a few extra pieces, to which DJ got an attitude, glared at me and said, \"No, I gave him extra bacon.\" The driver then turned to me and said that there was nothing he could do because DJ had given me extra bacon. I then told the driver to just cancel my pizza, because the amount of bacon on the pizza was what I used to get with a single order of bacon. I would not have had a problem with the order and just chalked it up to poor portioning had DJ not have gotten an attitude. After all, I wasn\\'t asking for much, just to get what I paid for (I would like to mention here that I always get extra bacon because I do like to have a decent amount of bacon on my pizza, and only twice have I requested a bit extra. I like having at least one-piece bacon in every bite, which I don\\'t feel is too much to ask). The driver attempted to change my order, but needed a reduced authorization (?) so DJ came flying around the corner asking what was wrong with my order, and the driver told him that I did not want the pizza. DJ shouted at me saying, \"Dude, I swear on my life I put extra bacon on here!\" to which I told him that there was no extra, that I normally get way more than that. Again, I don\\'t expect much from a pizza, that\\'s why I order extra bacon, because I like having a little bit more than what normally comes on the pizza, and to me the pizza looked like a normal serving, with all the bacon clumped in the middle. DJ then said, \"Well, you\\'re wrong!\" and grabbed the pizza box and threw it on the shelf, and went back around to making his pizza.

I go there and the pizza price came to near $18.00 which I had no intention of paying. Her reasoning is that they added $x.xx for each topping. I made mention that it\\'s one of the specialties and not one that\\'s an every topping priced individually. The store - no prices displayed AT ALL. I did however point out to this girl the $4.00 special sign that even a blind person can\\'t miss I originally called for. She acted as though she has never seen it before. I looked at the fold up menu - nope no prices. No way to figure out anything on an individual pizza unless I got a combo special. She and two hourly were sctratching there heads over the cash register trying to figure out what to do. Gradually the price came down, again without rhyme or reason as to where they were getting the number from. The pizza was the wrong size, I pointed out as well and managed to get them to a more than fair price of just under $12.00. They were all sorts of confused of course and honestly very nice about it. There was simply no training apparent in this store. In the end we got the pizza home, it was hot, it was as tasty as a Domino\\'s can be exepcted to be and of course....Me - Dan, is there any bacon on your slices? Dan - Nope - yours? Me - Nope. Sigh....I\\'ll try again next year. They are acting against the consumer pricing law. There is nothing displayed, on the wall, and the menu pricing is very incomplete. Surprise charges are appearing on the bill.

One of the coupons that the book has is from Domino’s (buy any, one or more toping large pizza, and get another free of equal or lesser value), and there’s no restriction whatsoever. Besides buying other stuff throughout the year from Domino’s, I had been using this coupon to buy one spatiality pizza (it has more than one topping) at the regular menu price and get another one for free as indicated.\\n                                        More\\n                                    To make long story short with the limited messaging space, today 3/16/2022, at around 8:30pm, when I went to the Freehold, NJ store and presented the coupon (it’s only valid at Freehold, NJ store), I was told it was not valid for Specialty pizza - minding you that there’s nowhere in it or in the book, it mentions of any restriction other than the standard “can’t be used with any other coupons,” and I have been using it for over 10 years.\\n                                    \\n                                \\n                                    \\n                                        Anyhow, an argument erupted – I, saying that I had used the coupon before and him emphasizing that it can’t be true, and we went back and forth several times.It that point, I asked him how long he’s been working at Domino’s? His answer was 11 years. Obviously frustrated, I replied to that “it can’t be. If you did, you’d know. I’d like to talk to the manager please.” To that his reply was “If that’s going to be your attitude, I’m not going to serve you. Please leave the store.” Why would I leave the store, was my question, and asked him again if I could talk to the manager? To that he replied because I said so, and I can because I’m the general manager. Nowhere in the argument there was and profanity from either one of us, nor there was any raise of voice beyond reasonable excitement. I left the store, but before I left, I asked what his name was? He replied “I don’t have to give you that,” and refused to give me his name. Chris was his name which I found out from a driver outside.If someone please call me from Dominos HQ, we can talk and clarify more. I’m not looking to get free pizza or bunch of coupons from Domino’s, but what I’m looking for is an apology – in front of all the staff that he had at the time. An apology for the undignified behavior that absolutely wasn’t called for, is far more important to me than free handouts. Hopefully you and I can resolve this issue rationally, and farther escalation wouldn’t be necessary.

They said \"that ** all she does is complain, I made that food fresh, every time she calls in she always has something to ** about\", I have only ever called in aside from the other reasoning, but, to sometimes address how good the food was at that time or that \"hey you know, a drink was forgotten, no worries or rush just wanted y\\'all to know\", and that is about it, I have never been rude to these people ever and have ALWAYS tried to be civil, but, I addressed it on the phone and I said \"there is no right for y\\'all to talk so d*mn bad about me when I have never done anything to y\\'all\" and they guy told me \"you better stop cursing at me\", and I was like \"I am a grown woman in my 20\\'s, and y\\'all are ganging up against me in a public business and me on hold hearing it all\". This is downright disgusting and absolutely traumatic including all other experiences.I told them I will no longer order there anymore and will take my business to Papa Johns, and they said \"you can stop cussing at me is what you can do\", and I said d*mn twice, I am sure people has heard worse in this world, so, therefore, I addressed that I would be contacting corporate for the first time and will be writing reviews anywhere I can, I did not get around to talking to corporate as I had lost 4 relatives back to back due to Covid-19, and I just became overwhelmed with a lot in life, but, why I chose to write now, is I just called just a few moments ago, I told them \"hey I have not ordered here for a few months and I am a little nervous ordering again because I don\\'t want anyone to contaminate my food or spit on/destroy it\".

I am in San Diego Ca. She is located in Barstow. Now I ordered a pizza online for them using my DEBIT card because I can not do anything from where I am located at. I ordered a simple two pizzas and had it delivered to them. I also put it in the instructions. I Have done this over the past 20 years. May I remind you, I have ordered for family members many times and had it sent to their address. NEVER have I had an issue until today.The delivery driver came to the her house with me on the telephone and they said they needed to see a driver\\'s license and the credit card that purchased the food. They stated their best friend ordered the pizza for them as a gift to help out for Christmas to have something in there bellies. I have all the debit card Information. The delivery driver \"Tracy\" was extremely rude to my friend stating \"No Credit card and ID no pizza, You guys will need to call the company!\"I understand rules and regulations however remind you I did call ahead of time and asked them if I could order a pizza from San Diego to Barstow. They said YES. I have done this multiple times prior with out issue, They refused to give the pizzas to my best friend.

Moving forward I forgive them but I can promise you this has left such a sick sour taste in my mouth in regards to ALL DOMINOS Stores now, Simply due to ONE bad apple. I promise you I will NEVER EAT NOR PURCHASE FOOD from their store again, nor will I eat their pizza at any party or friend\\'s house. I will make sure all of my family and loved ones and friends STAY AWAY from Dominos and I pray forgiveness on their evil corporate greedy hearts.

Where this hidden policy is located at so I can see it? Also if they can make a one time exception due to circumstances. The women was straight to the point. \"Debit card holder has to be present, with photo ID\" NO ID NO DEBIT Card no pizza, I can refund the money to you? I said, \"Wow OK. How disgusting.\" She said, \"Yeah unfortunately a lot of Deliver drivers are just lazy and don\\'t follow the rules!\"\"Hang up!\"I called back with no answer. They kept me on hold forever. Cool so now I will do EVERYTHING and ANYTHING in my power to boycott this location and the company if you\\'re so Corporate greedy on Christmas day to not allow someone to eat a pizza due to policy...? Bring the pizzas back and eat them or throw them away?? So moving forward I will NEVER EVER order pizza from this establishment again nor will I help with bringing them any kind of business and trust me...I will make sure family and friends DO NOT support this place EVER again.This is Christmas?

Apparently there was an altercation about getting a refund because my daughter never got her pizza because she wasn’t at the hot spot. I just called the pizza place and they told me they in fact told my daughter they would not give her her money back.

(Trust me I was shocked by the customer service and was only calling to see what happen to my daughter 21 dollars which is not hard to come by at 16. It’s kind of a big deal.) I had to redirect the young girl I was speaking to and calmly tell her that I was only calling to see what happen and why they didn’t refund the money. She said that was policy. I went in Domino\\'s website to read what they had written and it only says if you\\'re not satisfied they will refund your money. I asked her, \"Was this policy online?\" She started telling me how they are a five star restaurant. I asked her like my mother did prior for corporate number and she told me she can’t give that out. If I want it I should google it. (Really I spend money and put this food in my body and corporate number is not accessible to me? Mind you my mother a senior 70, not really a pro at the computer.) So she’s tells me this policy is a franchise policy that states if you order hotspot and the pizza not successfully delivered that you don’t get your money back. I had to ask for like the 10th time. \"I understand mam however is this policy somewhere visual for the customer.\" She stated, \"I don’t know???\" I thanked her and ended the phone call. There still a lot I didn’t not tell you but what is unacceptable is this employee\\'s behavior. I spent 10 min on the phone listening to this women tell me how my senior mother and my child were wrong and then she started giving instruction on how I need to correct my child. Unbelievable. I still didn’t get upset because that’s not what I do. However I am disturbed that this person is working. Oh and I don’t even know whom this women was because before she started reciting the franchise inside policy that she doesn’t know if it is visual to customer, she told me that the manager was on the phone and couldn’t come to the phone. Before I could finish my statement she cut me off in a very nasty condescending manner and said, \"Yes I know about this situation,\" and just went off. I still was very nice to her because she probably too is just a young child trying to make a couple of dollars. However Jennifer or the manager, I don’t know, I never got a chance to speak with them. I never got past the women whom knows policy but not whether is visual or not. It’s just really sad that we support business like this and I will Tweet, FB, Yelp, Pinterest and more this situation because it’s not fair to my daughter. It’s also not fair that I was very pleasant and I had to be cut off and told how to raise my child from a child. All because of a misunderstanding with ordering a pizza. What happen to conflict and resolution skill training on jobs, what happen to the customer is always right? This place will not get any more of my family\\'s money and I will make sure this complaint is received by corporate and dealt with accordingly. I do know how to google research and find things.

This was my salad that you call a chicken caesar salad. Are you freaking kidding me? It doesn't even have enough lettuce. It's not even filled up to the top. It's prepackaged crap. How can you sit there and say that you make fresh pizzas and fresh food when you're serving this for $7? \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why you're gonna be losing business because people can order this, or they can go to Happy's and get an amazing, fantastic, fresh, huge salad for the same price that you charge for that crud. Not only that, but the three pizzas I ordered were so light on the sauce that they were dry, and the cheese was dry and nasty. I was quite disappointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only highlight of my visit there was that the cashier was very friendly and nice. But your food is two thumbs down.\")\n",

If it's not a 2 hour wait, my order's wrong. Seriously, how hard is it to throw in the right dressing? I've not gotten my drinks before too. Maybe you need to look into hiring competent staff? If I could give them negative stars I would.\")\n",

When it was ready, I saw my pizza had the garlic parmesan white cheese on it instead of tomato sauce and it was a medium size without any toppings on it. I informed the cashier and he called up his manager. The manager totally objected that he put white cheese on my pizza, then he became enraged and swung my pizza at the garbage can and the pizza rolled off the floor. Then he ordered me to get out the store, pointing his hand toward the door in front of a dozen of customers. I cannot believe that Domino store manager has the audacity to humiliate and disrespect a customer as such instead of being apologetic, courteous and polite.')\n",

I hope the name he told me is correct, as it does not state his name on my receipt, but has server #3400 printed on it. Also... at first he told me that he did not have a receipt to give me and then a few minutes later, he produces one, saying... \"Oh I thought I left it at the restaurant.\" \\n                                        More\\n                                    So, a woman was sitting in the front passenger seat and a young girl was sitting in the back seat.

He didn\\'t have my pizza or my chicken in the heat wave red bag, but sitting on the back seat! So, Carlos then hands me all of my six items, without a bag or any napkins! All this was quite cumbersome to carry with no bag! It wasn\\'t professional that he had passengers in the car, handling my food. This is shockingly my first time experiencing a driver having passengers in his vehicle, having a child pass me my food!

It didn\\'t help matters that he didn\\'t even say thank you for my order! He said that I should blame the GM, general manager for no bag or no napkins. I am quite sure that Carlos could have found a bag in Domino\\'s and some napkins! My Goodness! Domino\\'s should go out of business if they can\\'t supply these basic staples with an order.

He lied and said he was inside the parking lot fence but I was standing outside waiting for him and he did not arrive before me! Now... onto the food, which made my experience go from bad to worst. The food was greasy and gross, with too much tomato sauce and grease on the pizza and barely warm!!! The chicken looked like it was re-heated over, with dried up tomatoes on top of it and didn\\'t taste fresh either! It too was swimming in grease. It made me feel queasy and upset my stomach! I ended up throwing this Domino\\'s food in the garbage! I reached out to Domino\\'s. Mary ** of Domino\\'s Risk Management cowardly sent me an email and wasn\\'t professional enough to call. I gave them my number to find out about my bad ordeal with this order! She said in her email that she was not going to do anything to fix this bad ordeal. I even sent her pictures so she could see all the grease! The boxes even had the grease soaked through, getting me and my clothes greasy! I also gave them my order number from off of my receipt!

Well... years later, with my first online purchase last night... their pizza is worst than cardboard tasting! It is extremely greasy, under cooked, doughy tasting, gooey with way too much tomato sauce and my chicken dish was also very greasy and stale! This is way too much turmoil to go through!

Next, a different male employee mentioned that he would make me another pizza. I told him no, I just want a refund. In the meantime, while still waiting on my refund, no one threw away the pizza dough, no one sanitized the pizza dough prep area, and no one did anything regarding public safety at that Reidville Road location in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Finally, a young female kindly gave me my refund, and I went to a competitor to get a safer-to-eat pizza.\\n                                    More')\n",

I\\'ve never received such a crazy percentage discount from any kind of company. This makes me think that they purposely overprice their pizzas, then send out massive amounts of coupons to look good. There\\'s no other explanation. The issue is when you stop getting coupons. What I used to do was use every online coupon I could, student coupon deals, and I\\'d personally email representatives and also fill out customer response surveys to keep getting more coupons sent to my home address. BUT, after I kept using 50% off coupons for about six months, my phone number and address pretty much got blocked from receiving further coupons!\\n                                        More\\n                                    In fact, the very last pizza I had order with Domino\\'s had such, such terrible customer service that led me to this fact. After I had asked for my subtotal with a 50% off coupon, the fellow on the phone told me, \"Dude. You\\'ve used 50% off coupons like ten times now. Please tell me how to get them, I want them too!\" which I knew was clearly bait, but I told him in response a truthful statement, \"I am a valued customer, I complete surveys and always give feedback.\" Then, instead of the usual faces who delivered my pizza I saw some kind of hotshot supervisor who drove a very luxurious vehicle. I gave him my final 50% off coupon, and he furiously searched through it for anything that could be incorrect. To his dismay, it was a correct and legal, bonafide coupon - both the address and the expiration date were okay.After that, I\\'d still give feedback, complete surveys etc. while providing my address, but instead, no more coupons ever came to my house like before. So for some reason, it seems like someone high-up put something in their system to never give me coupons again. I kept doing what I was doing for a few more months - I even wrote a review that was so amazing, my local branch stuck on their wall in their employee area, but no more coupons ever came. See, the truth was that my mother had an accident, so we had to order food on the days she required physiotherapy each week - and Domino\\'s was one of my favourite places because of the 50% off coupons. That review I made is what got posted in their employee area, according to a representative that I spoke with, and I was quite proud that I could make them feel good because their pizzas were top-notch.Just a really big shame. I would\\'ve kept ordering from Domino\\'s if I never got the 50% off coupons at all! It\\'s the fact that you would give me these coupons each month, then make a big stink about it that really makes me sad. Seriously - I\\'d get mailed these coupons so frequently, then the customer representative I would call to order my pizzas would complain about me using them? I would always shove these coupons in their face, even when I wasn\\'t asked to because I want to be completely transparent. If I had ordered and not produced the coupons, then I would understand the company being mad, but that is clearly not the case! They got mad at me because I was, essentially, a fellow taking advantage of their deals and they didn\\'t like that.Anyways, my recommendation is to just spend a similar amount of money and get pizzas from elsewhere. Pizza Nova is definitely good. But, I really, really love Pizza Hut now because their pizzas are extremely thick - just a couple of those slices would fill me up for the whole day! Their pizzas are like pizza pies with how much cheese is in them! When I spend money, I don\\'t just want good food, I want good quality customer service, which was sadly NOT what I had received at my local Domino\\'s restaurant!\\n                                    More')\n",

Her husband Steven (non-employee of Domino\\'s) walks over from the gas station side, tells me to leave the store or he would call the police. So I tell him to back off since both of us are being recorded on camera, and the police can easily see the footage. He backs off to the other side of the store and keeps staring at us.Alexis starts making the pizzas, she is not wearing any polythene gloves used in food processing. She put the cheese and meat, and then shockingly reached into the waste and scrap (dump) pit under the table, grabbed pepperoni and sausage pieces and put them on my pizza. (This pit/dump is a collection bin for all the scrap and waste that gets cleaned off the prep table to be discarded.) When I questioned her she completely denied it and handed me the boxes and walked into the back of the store. I hope there is a CCTV camera in the prep & cooking area to see this scenario unfold. Needless to say, I walked out and left the full boxes on the trash bin outside the store.Domino\\'s will never get my business again.

By 8 pm I had received no further updates. By 815 I called the store and was told delivery was expected to be between 3 and 4 HOURS.

This store was going to let my pizzas and wings sit in a warming oven for 4 hours and assumed that that is just going to be okay. Well it's not. (It's actually a health code violation.) Instead of waiting until 11 pm for my pizza I decided to go pick it up myself. No offer for a discount was made or apology offered, the only thing they did was remove the delivery charge.I have a strong background in customer service and this is not how you treat customers. When you make a mistake you're supposed to make it right. I'm not saying I should have gotten my order free but a simple $4 or $5 off would have been nice considering that by the time I got my pizzas they had been drying out in a warmer for over an hour (and they tasted like it too). To make matters worse they forgot to give me my 2 liter of pop and I didn't realize until I was home. The real kicker here is that this all could have been avoided with a simple phone call to say 'hey we're sorry but it's going to be a while, do you want to pick up your order instead?'I mean what's worse? Losing out on $25 bucks because someone says 'no, just cancel my order' or losing the potential for hundreds of dollars because they had to wait 4 hours for a pizza that gets there practically cold and very dry, gets angry about it, never orders for your location again, and then tells all their friends and family about it?

A couple days later I placed another order for pretty much the same thing I ordered last time, still using the online app but didn\\'t see the credit for my drink. So after calling Domino\\'s, I\\'m informed that I would have to call in my order to get my credit on my drink.

Over an hour goes by and after calling Domino\\'s, they said my order was returned to the store because my address was wrong. The gentlemen I talked to offered no apology and was making it sound like it was my fault that the address was wrong. I told him that they deliver to me constantly, and I just had an order delivered a couple days ago with no problem. I told him what my correct address is and even said that it\\'s correct in the online app when I place my orders. He said he would have to remake my order to have it delivered fresh. I was not happy about this. I checked the online app and it said my order had been delivered. Which was false. This really set me off. That is the single most way to lose me as a customer and that\\'s dishonesty. So after 2 hours of placing my order, it finally arrives. The driver makes no apologies whatsoever. Driver doesn\\'t say anything at all really. Of course I left no tip. I look at the label on the box that was delivered and sure enough it doesn\\'t have my correct address (yet the driver somehow magically found my place this time? makes no sense). I also just happen to have the pizza box from a couple days ago that was delivered, and my address is correct on that one. Both were delivered from the same Domino\\'s. How you mess that up is beyond me, but after this incident I am no longer going to be buying from Domino\\'s anymore.\\n                                    More')\n",

The one ended up being 8.07, and the other was 8.47. I didnt order anything extra, I didnt add anything other than the 3 toppings, but they still end up costing more than their advertised special. It doesnt seem like much of a big deal because its only a few cents, but when you add the thousands of people that probably get overcharged, it adds up.

This is a serious disappointment in terms of customer service. No one was picking call at the store, the delivery man didn't know what he was delivering and didn't even give me a receipt to sign.

I called back a second time, and was on hold for 12 minutes and 46 seconds before my call was actually answered, by an employee (whom later I find out his name is, **, and he contends to be the store manager). Here is how the conversation took place, in detail: Employee: \"Thanks for choosing Domino\\'s, is this for pick up or delivery?\" Me: \"I\\'m sorry, sir, do you realize that I have been on hold for over 12 minutes?\" Employee: \"Again, is this for pick up or delivery?\"\\n                                        More\\n                                    Me: \"Wow, really?

I called.\" Me: \"Okay, well, I am at a place of business and I only have a limited amount of time allotted to eat lunch.\" Employee: \"Okay, well, I\\'ll just cancel your order. Thanks.\" Phone hangs up.This individual gave me no opportunity to advise that I did not want to cancel my order! I wanted my order! I wanted my food! I was in shock. I called right back to let the employee know that I did not want to cancel my order, I just wanted them to hurry up a bit. Again, I waited on the phone, for 10 minutes with no answer. By this time I was a little upset, and I wanted to know the employee\\'s name, and his manager\\'s information. Under the circumstances, I was able to visit this store location in order to try to obtain the name of the individual that I had spoken to over the phone, and also the store manager\\'s information. When I walked in, there was no one in the store! In looking around for someone to assist me, I had noticed an extremely unsanitary and disgusting kitchen (which I have submitted photos of to Domino\\'s corporate office).I waited for literally, 2-3 minutes before an employee and a kid come out from the back. The kid walked straight out of the door, while the employee walked up to the counter. The employee asked, \"what can I do for you?\" I stated, \"My name is Shawn **. Are you the individual that I had just spoken to on the phone?\" The employee then states, \"Uhhh, well, my name isn\\'t Shawn **.\" I replied, \"No, my name is Shawn **, and I believe you are the person that I had spoken to over the phone a little ago (the voice matched perfectly). The employee states, \"Well, I speak to a lot of people... Well, yeah, yeah, that\\'s me.\" I then asked for his name, and he stated, \"**\". I then inquired, \"Okay, **, is there a manager that I can speak to?\" He stated, \"I\\'m the manager.\" I then stated, \"Wow, I am shocked. Your customer service is horrible. Do you understand that you unwillingly cancelled my order and then hung up on me?\"** stated, \"Well, you told me to cancel it.\" I stated, \"No, I sure did not. I wanted to know where my order was at in your process. Also, you were highly rude to me over the phone, and I was completely shocked that you cancelled my order, and then just hung up on me.\" I then advised that I wanted his manager\\'s name, in order to inquire as to if this is the type of customer service his store has to offer. I then received one of the biggest shocks (and I\\'ve been deployed in combat)! He said to me, \"Okay, sir, right now I\\'m going to go ahead and advise you to leave the store.\" WHAT?!?!?! I did not, at all, raise my voice, or become rude. I then stated, \"Excuse me? I have not raised my voice. I am simply trying to get answers, due to the extremely poor customer service that I have been given.\" He replied, \"Again, I am advising you to leave the store.\"I then said, \"Okay, okay, but your corporate office will be notified of this occurrence.\" ** replied, \"Great! I hope you do.\" Moreover, I have ordered from this location, at least twice a week, for about a month now, and each time have waited extended periods of time to receive my order, but I have been patient.

The offer was very specific in that you had to order online and then do carryout. I decided to use my credit card in store as opposed to putting it online. Apparently that was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. \\n                                        More\\n                                    I got to the Dominos in Fort Mill, SC off of Charlotte Hwy and they were kinda busy. I waited patiently even though the kid at the front was kinda rude and so was one of the other employees. I got up to the register to pay for my stuff and asked the kid to add 5 garlic butters which brought my total to $19.66. The kid had some problems logging into the computer in order to charge my card and kept having to ask the other rude employee what her pin code was. I didn\\'t really think anything of it so I paid, took my pizzas and left. I get home and one of my pizzas were completely wrong and another one was kinda burnt. Overall they all tasted just ok but I didn\\'t call in and complain. I just ate the pizza and tried to be happy. Well then, on Friday November 20th I was at the store at work trying to purchase a soda because I work in a call center and use my voice all day long. My debit card got declined. I was like \"what in the world there should definitely be money in my account\". I log into my banking app on my phone and discover multiple charges from Dominos on my account. The original one for $19.66 and another for $22.93 on Monday the 16th and then multiple pending charges from Friday the 20th. Five days after ordering my pizza they were charging my credit card even though I hadn\\'t been home all day. I freaked as you can imagine and called the store and demanded to know what was up. I was on my first break at work and my break was almost up so when the kid that answered the phone, asked me to put me on hold, I said \"no\". He was very rude from that point on even after I explained what was going on and then I told him I needed resolution ASAP. He commented that he couldn\\'t do anything for me so I told him to take down my contact info and have the manager call me back with a resolution during my lunch at 8:45 pm. When 8:45 got there I called back and asked to speak to the manager myself and he was very very rude and not apologetic at all. I explained the whole situation and then demanded a refund for all the charges that were on my card including the pizza charge for the inconvenience. The manager said that the only amount he could refund me was the original $19.66 and that the only way he could do that was if I gave him my debit card info over the phone which I obviously vetoed. I said that I would just come in the next day with my card and have them refund me where I could see it at which point he said \"you won\\'t be able to watch me anyways because I\\'ll have to do it in the back office.\" At this point I was very irate and told him that I guess I would just have to go to the better business bureau and hung up. I called Dominos Corporate number and spoke to a lady there. I gave her all the information I had at the time and told her that the resolution I wanted was for all the charges refunded and any overdraft fees that I incurred to be taken care of. She told me that there was nothing she could do for me because that was a franchise store and therefore all she could do is forward it to the owner of the franchise. I said \"ok\", got off the phone with her and then called my bank\\'s stolen credit card line. What I found out after talking to them floored me. They said that the charge from the 16th was from a completely different Dominos in Charlotte, NC and that there were 5 other pending transactions from either that store or another one also in Charlotte, NC. which is why my debit card was declined. I cut off my card and reported it lost/stolen so that nothing else would attempt to come through. On my way home that night (which was around 1 am), I called the local police department and filed a report. They met me up at the original Dominos and I explained the situation to them. But now I\\'m sitting here with no card, no money and no way to get my money back. I drive an hour one way to work each day and I don\\'t even have money for gas to get to work and Dominos acts like they couldn\\'t care.

I figured I would use the $10 coupon and try again since I've been ordering pizza from Domino's for years and never really had any issues until recently.

For starters, one of the pizza boxes was smashed and a 1/3 of one the toppings was stuck to the top of the box.\\n                                        More\\n                                    In addition, I was amazed to find that the both pizzas I ordered were again under cooked and doughy.

And last but not least, I ordered extra cheese and green pepper for an extra $2 and the toppings were comparable to the 50 or so other pizzas I've purchased in my lifetime from the establishment.

I asked if I could pay when I pick up, because I was walking to my girlfriend’s house to get my wallet, which I had forgotten before I left for school. All was well. When I arrived to pick up the pizza about 15 minutes later, it was ready and waiting for me and a driver was coming in at the same time. The employee who made my pizza, DJ, asked the driver to ring me up because he was busy making a pizza. The driver rung me up and stated that the total was $16 and change, which I knew was incorrect because I come in every week to get the $7.99 3-topping carryout special, always pepperoni and extra bacon, and the chicken was only $5.99. The driver immediately realized the problem and informed me that I had been rung up for a 1-topping pizza plus 2 additional toppings. No big deal, I assume on normal days that\\'s how a 3-topping pizza is rung up.\\n                                        More\\n                                    Before I paid, I lifted up the lid of the pizza box to see how much bacon was on the pizza, because normally there is more than enough bacon for me and my girlfriend, but a few times the person making the pizza forgot that it was extra bacon, and they are always more than happy to fix it. The driver informed me that they would have to sprinkle the bacon on top instead of making a new pizza, which I was fine with. No sense wasting an entire pizza, I don\\'t mind having to wait 5 minutes to get my correct order. The driver then turned to DJ and asked him if he would mind cooking up a few extra pieces, to which DJ got an attitude, glared at me and said, \"No, I gave him extra bacon.\" The driver then turned to me and said that there was nothing he could do because DJ had given me extra bacon. I then told the driver to just cancel my pizza, because the amount of bacon on the pizza was what I used to get with a single order of bacon. I would not have had a problem with the order and just chalked it up to poor portioning had DJ not have gotten an attitude. After all, I wasn\\'t asking for much, just to get what I paid for (I would like to mention here that I always get extra bacon because I do like to have a decent amount of bacon on my pizza, and only twice have I requested a bit extra. I like having at least one-piece bacon in every bite, which I don\\'t feel is too much to ask). The driver attempted to change my order, but needed a reduced authorization (?) so DJ came flying around the corner asking what was wrong with my order, and the driver told him that I did not want the pizza. DJ shouted at me saying, \"Dude, I swear on my life I put extra bacon on here!\" to which I told him that there was no extra, that I normally get way more than that. Again, I don\\'t expect much from a pizza, that\\'s why I order extra bacon, because I like having a little bit more than what normally comes on the pizza, and to me the pizza looked like a normal serving, with all the bacon clumped in the middle. DJ then said, \"Well, you\\'re wrong!\" and grabbed the pizza box and threw it on the shelf, and went back around to making his pizza. I then verified with the driver that his name was DJ and I didn\\'t hear it wrong, paid for my chicken and left.In this entire situation, I would have just paid for my order and left, but I do not need to be disrespected by employees and told that I am wrong on an order that I get every week. I know my order, and I am a very reasonable person. I understand that Domino\\'s is a company and part of being a company is not giving out pounds of bacon on each pizza, that\\'s not what I was asking for. I know how much bacon I normally get, and honestly, the amount I normally get is more than enough. I don\\'t want to say too much because it is bacon after all. But like I said, that bacon isn\\'t the issue here; it is merely the catalyst to why I am complaining. I understand if somebody is having a bad day, but that does not mean that it is okay to berate customers. I am still a loyal Domino\\'s customer, but from now on I will travel a bit farther to get my study snacks.\\n                                    More')\n",

(first warning that she has no clue) Me - No, I WANT bacon, no ham (followed by much back and forth of Who\\'s on First until the idea is conveyed). Her - So a large MeatZZa with no ham, right?Me - Almost - Pan pizza, and BACON! Her - OK, Thin crust pizza, no ham, add bacon.

I go there and the pizza price came to near $18.00 which I had no intention of paying. Her reasoning is that they added $x.xx for each topping. I made mention that it\\'s one of the specialties and not one that\\'s an every topping priced individually. The store - no prices displayed AT ALL. I did however point out to this girl the $4.00 special sign that even a blind person can\\'t miss I originally called for. She acted as though she has never seen it before. I looked at the fold up menu - nope no prices. No way to figure out anything on an individual pizza unless I got a combo special. She and two hourly were sctratching there heads over the cash register trying to figure out what to do. Gradually the price came down, again without rhyme or reason as to where they were getting the number from. The pizza was the wrong size, I pointed out as well and managed to get them to a more than fair price of just under $12.00. They were all sorts of confused of course and honestly very nice about it. There was simply no training apparent in this store. In the end we got the pizza home, it was hot, it was as tasty as a Domino\\'s can be exepcted to be and of course....Me - Dan, is there any bacon on your slices? Dan - Nope - yours? Me - Nope.

When an offer is made it should be honored. I never did get a human on the phone so I called back, and the same thing happened. I never did get any service ... The food isn't worth the trouble. I spent over an hour and a half on the phone. I've had trouble in the past. They are not reliable, their food is overpriced for the customer service that you receive.\")\n",

I keep getting alerts to earn a FREE Emergency Pizza with an order, so yesterday, I opened the app to place our order, and found 50 of my reward points missing. My account has never been inactive, so I know my points didn't expire. We were hungry, so I ordered anyway. After our food was delivered, I waited to see if our FREE Emergency Pizza would show up on my account. It never did. Honestly, between losing reward points, false free pizza advertising, and the outrageous $6.99 delivery charge on top of a tip, I'm extremely put off by Domino's altogether. It's time to find a new pizza spot.\")\n",

They transfer me to store 3 times for 5 min each. Store will not pick up. If it arrives sending back but my credit card was charged $61 at 308 pm.\")\n",
